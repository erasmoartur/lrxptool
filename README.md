# An Approach to Explore Logistic Regression Models
This tool applies the potential of Attribute-RadViz in identifying correlations levels of attributes to explore LR models. We focus on reducing the limitations of using those models in multidimensional data contexts. 

The tool includes the following aspects:
* feature selection,
* regression model construction,
* evaluating binary and multinomial regression, and 
* constructing a panorama for queries over the model.
