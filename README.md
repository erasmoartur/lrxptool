# An Approach to Explore Logistic Regression Models
This tool applies the potential of Attribute-RadViz in identifying correlations levels of attributes to explore LR models. We focus on reducing the limitations of using those models in multidimensional data contexts. 

The tool includes the following aspects:
* feature selection,
* regression model construction,
* evaluation of binary and multinomial regression, and 
* construction of a panorama for queries over the model.

## Installing and running

* Download this project and unzip in a local directory
* Open the HTML file in a browser (tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge)

## Getting started

* Rendering the first view:
  * Go to _Left panel->CSV File->Choose_ file to pick a CSV file.
  * Then choose a target attribute from _Left panel->Target Attribute_.
* Generation of logistic regression models:
  * Select attributes clicking over them and click over the dimensional anchor of the desired label.
